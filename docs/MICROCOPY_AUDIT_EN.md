## 2. UX & microcopy audit

### 2.1 Strengths

- **Value-first hero:** “Let AI do 30–50% of your daily tasks” is clear and benefit-led.
- **Scannable structure:** Sections (What you get, How to use, prompts, What’s next) are easy to scan.
- **Consistent pattern:** Each prompt card uses the same “Before using” / “What to do” structure.
- **Action-oriented CTAs:** “Start for free”, “Copy prompt”, “Join WhatsApp group” state the action.
- **Time framing:** “~3–5 min per step” and “In 30 minutes” set expectations.
- **Progress copy:** “You’ve used X of 8 prompts” and “Great – you’ve used all 8” support motivation.

### 2.2 Issues and recommendations

#### A. Clarity and consistency

| Item | Issue | Recommendation |
|------|--------|----------------|
| **“For?”** (header-meta) | “For?” alone is cryptic; “Who it’s for” is in aria-label only. | Use visible copy: “For: Managers, specialists, consultants, freelancers.” or “Who it’s for: Managers, specialists, consultants, freelancers.” |
| **“Click here and copy”** (code-block) | “Here” is vague for screen readers; “copy” could mean “duplicate” or “copy to clipboard”. | Prefer: “Click to select, then copy” or “Select and copy prompt” (align with aria-label). |
| **“Select text”** (error fallback) | Shown when no specific error is passed; generic. | Keep as last-resort; consider “Copy didn’t work. Select the text and press Ctrl+C.” for fallback path. |

#### B. Tone and wording

| Item | Issue | Recommendation |
|------|--------|----------------|
| **“What you actually get”** | “Actually” can sound defensive. | “What you get” or “What’s included” is neutral and clear. |
| **“chaotic prompts”** (objectives) | Slightly negative. | “Clear automation logic instead of ad‑hoc prompts” or “structured workflows instead of one-off prompts”. |
| **“Good luck with your analysis”** | Generic; “analysis” may not match all use cases. | “Good luck with your prompts” or “Good luck putting this into practice” to match the product. |

#### C. Errors and edge cases (JS)

| Item | Issue | Recommendation |
|------|--------|----------------|
| **“Error: missing parameters”** | Technical; users never “pass parameters”. | Don’t show this to users (handle in code). If something fails, show: “Something went wrong. Try copying again.” |
| **“Prompt not found”** | Technical. | Same as above; generic recovery message is better. |
| **“Prompt is empty”** | Technical. | Same; generic message. |
| **“Copy failed”** | Clear but no next step. | “Copy failed. Try selecting the text and pressing Ctrl+C (or Cmd+C).” |
| **“Failed. Select the text manually and copy.”** | Good direction; “Failed” is abrupt. | “Copy didn’t work. Select the text and copy with Ctrl+C (or Cmd+C).” |
| **Toast “Copied.” vs button “Copied!”** | Inconsistent punctuation. | Use one style: e.g. “Copied” everywhere (or “Copied!” everywhere). |

#### D. Accessibility (aria-labels)

| Item | Current | Recommendation |
|------|---------|----------------|
| Code block | “Select and copy prompt N” | Good. |
| Copy button | “Copy prompt N to clipboard” | Good. |
| Success | “Prompt copied successfully” | Good. |
| Community primary CTA | “Open Prompt Anatomy WhatsApp group in new tab” | Slightly wrong (it’s “Prompt Anatomy” product but the group may have another name). Consider: “Join Prompt Anatomy WhatsApp group (opens in new tab)”. |
| Progress bar | `aria-label="Progress"` | Optional: “Progress: X of 8 prompts used” for more context. |

#### E. Consistency with product naming

| Item | Note |
|------|------|
| **“DI Prompt Library”** (privacy, footer) vs **“Prompt Anatomy”** (badge, product link) | Decide: is the product “Prompt Anatomy” and this the “DI Prompt Library” spin-off, or one name for the app? Ensure privacy and footer use the chosen naming. |
| **“Spin-off No. 1”** | Clear; keep as is if that’s the brand. |

#### F. Privacy page

| Item | Issue | Recommendation |
|------|--------|----------------|
| **“← Back to library”** vs **“← Back to DI Prompt Library”** | Two different link texts at top and bottom. | Use one: e.g. “← Back to library” in both places, or “Back to DI Prompt Library” if you want the full name. |
| **“We do not collect any personal data at this time.”** | Clear. | Optional: “We don’t collect personal data.” for a slightly friendlier tone. |

#### G. Instructions (step 4)

| Item | Current (condensed) | Note |
|------|----------------------|------|
| Placeholders | “[COMPANY]”, “[MY ROLE]”; “replace with your or your client’s company” | Clear. “The AI role … is already in the prompt – no need to change it” is good. Consider one short sentence: “Replace only [COMPANY] and [MY ROLE]; leave the AI role as is.” |

---

## 3. Summary table – priority

| Priority | Area | Action |
|----------|------|--------|
| **High** | Hero “For?” | Replace with “Who it’s for:” or “For:” + list so it’s clear without aria. |
| **High** | JS errors | Replace technical messages (“missing parameters”, “Prompt not found”, “Prompt is empty”) with a single user-facing message; improve “Copy failed” / fallback with next step (Ctrl+C). |
| **Medium** | “Click here and copy” | Change to “Select and copy” or “Click to select, then copy”. |
| **Medium** | Toast vs button | Unify “Copied” / “Copied!”. |
| **Medium** | “What you actually get” | Consider “What you get” or “What’s included”. |
| **Low** | “Good luck with your analysis” | Consider “Good luck with your prompts” or similar. |
| **Low** | Privacy back link | Use same label at top and bottom. |
| **Low** | Progress `aria-label` | Optionally make dynamic (“Progress: X of 8 prompts used”). |

## 4. Questions for product / content (decisions 2026-03-06)

1. **Product name in UI:** Use “Prompt Anatomy” as main brand; “DI Prompt Library” only as secondary descriptor where useful. *Applied in privacy title, back link, root redirect.*
2. **Audience:** “Managers, specialists, consultants, freelancers” kept in hero as “Who it’s for:”.
3. **Error handling:** No technical errors in UI; user-facing messages only; manual copy hint when clipboard fails. *Applied in JS.*
4. **Tone:** (Privacy “We do not collect” vs “We don’t collect”) – left for later; backlog optional.
5. **Localization:** EN string sync note added to MULTILINGUAL_STRUCTURE.md §4 so LT stays aligned when EN changes.

---

## 5. Files to update (when implementing)

- **`en/index.html`** – hero meta, instructions, code-block ::before, next steps, community, footer, progress text; all JS error/success strings and aria-labels.
- **`en/privacy.html`** – back link(s), optional tone tweaks.
- **Root `index.html`** – only if redirect or product name copy is changed.

---

## 6. High-priority changes applied (2026-03-06)

- **Hero:** “For?” → “Who it's for:” (visible and aria).
- **JS errors:** All technical messages replaced with user-facing copy:
  - Generic: “Something went wrong. Try copying again.”
  - When clipboard/manual copy needed: “Copy didn't work. Select the text and use Ctrl+C (or Cmd+C).” or same with “Select the text and use Ctrl+C (or Cmd+C).” where relevant.
  - `aria-label` on error: no longer prefixed with “Error:”.
- **Product naming:** “Prompt Anatomy” as primary brand:
  - `en/privacy.html`: title “Privacy policy – Prompt Anatomy”; bottom link “← Back to library”.
  - Root `index.html`: title “Redirect – Prompt Anatomy”.
- **LT sync:** EN string sync note added to [docs/MULTILINGUAL_STRUCTURE.md](MULTILINGUAL_STRUCTURE.md) §4.

---

## 7. Backlog – medium/low (exact diffs)

Apply when ready; keep LT in sync per MULTILINGUAL_STRUCTURE.md §4.

### Medium

**7.1 Code-block tooltip (CSS)** – `en/index.html`, in `.code-block::before`:

```css
/* Current */
content: 'Click here and copy';

/* Suggested */
content: 'Select and copy';
```

**7.2 Toast vs button – unify “Copied”** – `en/index.html`:

- Toast (HTML): `<span>Copied.</span>` → `<span>Copied</span>` (no period), or keep and change button to “Copied.” for consistency.
- Button (JS) `showSuccess`: `'<span>Copied!</span>'` → `'<span>Copied</span>'` to match toast, or keep “Copied!” and set toast to “Copied!”.

**7.3 Objectives H2** – `en/index.html`:

```html
<!-- Current -->
<h2 ...>What you actually get</h2>

<!-- Suggested -->
<h2 ...>What you get</h2>
```

### Low

**7.4 Footer H3** – `en/index.html`:

```html
<!-- Current -->
<h3>Good luck with your analysis ...</h3>

<!-- Suggested -->
<h3>Good luck with your prompts ...</h3>
```

**7.5 Progress bar `aria-label`** – `en/index.html`: optional. Update the progress bar element so `aria-label` is dynamic, e.g. “Progress: X of 8 prompts used” (would require JS to set it when count changes).

**7.6 Privacy – back link** – Already aligned: both top and bottom use “← Back to library” after high-priority pass.
